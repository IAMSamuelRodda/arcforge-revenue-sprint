## Quick Facts

**Project**: Revenue acceleration strategy for Arc Forge business

## Before You Start

## Critical Constraints

1. **Cash-First Mindset**: ONLY work on revenue-generating activities
2. **No Product Development**: All product work (design-forge, agents) on hold
3. **Services Over Products**: Sell services first, build products later with cash flow
4. **4-Week Runway**: Must generate first revenue within 4 weeks or pivot
5. **$250/Week Minimum**: After-tax profit target to sustain business
6. **ABN Ready**: Can invoice immediately when clients secured
