## Week 1 (Nov 20-27, 2025)

### [2025-11-20] - Project Launch

**Added:**
- Complete revenue sprint project structure
- 7 core documentation files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STATUS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- Detailed service offerings and pricing strategy
- Three-track revenue model documentation
- Week-by-week roadmap (4 weeks)
- Email/call scripts and templates
- Task management workflow
- Metrics tracking framework

**Strategic Decisions:**
- ADR-001: Services-first revenue model (pause all product development)
- ADR-002: Three-track parallel execution (Freelance/B2B/Productized)
- ADR-003: arcforge.au single-page launch (speed over perfection)

**Context:**
Critical business inflection point. Need $250/week profit within 4 weeks to sustain Arc Forge business systems service. Pivoting from product development to services to generate immediate cash flow.

**Next Milestones:**
- arcforge.au website deployed (target: Nov 21)
- Upwork profile created and approved (target: Nov 21-22)
- First 10 Upwork bids submitted (target: Nov 22)
