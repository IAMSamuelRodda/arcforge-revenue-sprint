## Escalation & Decisions

**Since this is a solo sprint:**

**Blocked on task?**
→ Document blocker in STATUS.md
→ Find workaround or move to next priority
→ Don't wait - make decision and move forward

**Strategy not working?**
→ Pivot after 1 week of data (not 1 day)
→ Document change in ARCHITECTURE.md (ADR)
→ Update targets in STATUS.md

**Opportunity outside plan?**
→ Ask: "Will this generate revenue THIS MONTH?"
→ If yes → pursue
→ If no → defer until sprint complete
