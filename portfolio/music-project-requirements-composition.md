## Original Composition Project Requirements

### Requirement 1: Music Track Description

To get started, I will need a short description of the type of music track you want. For example, "An epic full orchestra sound with a dark, sinister vibe", or "I need a carefree lord of the rings style melody that loops nicely", etc.

**Type:** Free text
**Mandatory:** Yes

---

### Requirement 2: Reference Tracks

I will need 2-3 reference tracks (YouTube links are perfect) with at least one thing you liked about each track.

**Type:** Free text (URLs)
**Mandatory:** Yes

---

### Requirement 3: Context and Use Case

Context helps inspire creativity, and it helps determine what systems to optimise the final mix for. I can do this much better if you are able to tell me what you want to use the music for and on what devices it will most often be listened to.

**Type:** Free text
**Mandatory:** Yes

---

### Requirement 4: File Format

Let me know what file format you need the audio delivered in. I will default to lossless WAV files, but it can be any other common audio format you need.

**Type:** Free text
**Mandatory:** No (defaults to WAV)
