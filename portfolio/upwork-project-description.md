# Upwork Project Description - Self-Hosted Business Infrastructure

**Created:** 2025-11-23
**Status:** Ready for Upwork submission

---

## Project Summary (800 characters)

```
Stop renting your business technology from multiple vendors and own your infrastructure instead.

I deploy production-ready, self-hosted business cloud infrastructure on YOUR private server. You get file storage & collaboration (Nextcloud), password management (Vaultwarden), automation platform (n8n), remote access (Headscale VPN), and website hosting - all integrated and working together.

Perfect for 3-10 person teams who want:
• Control over their data (not multi-tenant vendor databases)
• Fixed, predictable costs (no surprise price increases)
• Freedom from vendor lock-in
• Professional infrastructure without complexity

Typical savings: $6,180/year compared to equivalent SaaS subscriptions.

You get complete documentation, professional setup, and 2 weeks post-launch support. Optional ongoing monitoring available.

All services run on a single VPS with automated backups, SSL certificates, and 99.5% uptime guarantee.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Client purchases the project and sends requirements
*(Upwork default - not edited)*

### Step 2: You complete the project following these steps:

#### 1. Requirements Confirmation
```
I review your team size, domain name, and service requirements. We confirm VPS provider, deployment timeline, and any specific customization needs.
```

#### 2. Infrastructure Deployment
```
I provision your VPS, deploy all selected services (Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, n8n, Headscale, website hosting), configure integrations, set up automated backups, and SSL certificates. All services tested and production-ready.
```

#### 3. Documentation & Handover
```
You receive complete documentation: system architecture, user guides, admin procedures, backup verification, and troubleshooting steps. I walk you through the setup during a handover session.
```

#### 4. Testing & Review
```
You and your team test the infrastructure, verify all services work as expected, and I address any adjustments needed before final approval.
```

### Step 3: Client reviews and approves your work, and you get paid

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What support do you provide after delivery?
```
2 weeks of post-launch support is included after project approval. During this period, I'm available to answer questions, troubleshoot any issues, and ensure smooth operation. After that, optional ongoing monitoring and support packages are available.
```

### Q2: What happens if something breaks after the 2-week support period?
```
The infrastructure is designed to be stable and low-maintenance. You'll have complete documentation for troubleshooting. I offer optional ongoing support packages ($150/mo) that include monitoring, updates, and priority assistance. Many clients run for months without issues.
```

### Q3: Do I need to keep paying you monthly?
```
No. After the one-time setup fee and 2-week support period, there are no mandatory ongoing payments to me. You pay your VPS provider directly (~$75/mo). Ongoing monitoring/support is completely optional - you own the infrastructure and can manage it yourself or hire anyone you want.
```

### Q4: Can I cancel my VPS later without losing my data?
```
Yes. You own all your data and have full server access. You can migrate to a different VPS provider, back up and shut down the server, or transition to other solutions. No vendor lock-in - your infrastructure, your choice.
```

### Q5: How long does the deployment take?
```
Typical delivery: 7-10 days from requirements to go-live. This includes infrastructure setup, testing, documentation, and handover session. Rush delivery available for urgent needs.

3. **Cost transparency** - Clear separation: one-time setup vs ongoing VPS hosting
4. **Professional delivery** - Documentation, testing, handover process
5. **Optional support** - No mandatory ongoing payments to Arc Forge

- **Support positioning:** Moved to FAQs to avoid confusion about when payment happens
- **Ownership messaging:** Emphasizes private server, control, no third-party access (not just "data in Australia")
- **Cost clarity:** Big "SAVED" label on $6,180 figure to avoid confusion in thumbnails
