## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None (Day 1)

### Risks
1. **Risk**: Upwork profile approval delay (can take 24-48 hours)
   - **Mitigation**: Apply Tuesday, have backup (Freelancer.com) ready

2. **Risk**: No response from cold outreach
   - **Mitigation**: Test multiple message variants, track open/response rates

3. **Risk**: Low Upwork bid success rate (competitive platform)
   - **Mitigation**: Volume (10/week), focus on jobs with <5 proposals

4. **Risk**: 4-week timeline too short for B2B sales cycle
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel tracks (freelance faster), extend conversations into Week 5-6
