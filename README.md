## Overview

**Critical Business Goal**: Generate $250/week profit (after tax) within 4 weeks to sustain Arc Forge business systems service.

**Strategy**: Services-first approach leveraging existing DevOps/automation skills to generate immediate cash flow, postponing product development until revenue is stable.

**Timeline**: Nov 20 - Dec 18, 2025 (4 weeks)

## The Situation

### Current State
- **Revenue**: $0/week
- **Costs**: $43/month VPS + living expenses
- **Runway**: 4-8 weeks before must pivot to employment
- **Assets**: ABN ready, strong technical skills, multiple unfinished products
- **Problem**: Building products (3-6 months to revenue) instead of selling services (weeks to revenue)

Stop building products. Start selling services. Use proven skills to generate cash NOW.

## The Hard Truth

**You have excellent technical skills but zero revenue.**

This sprint forces the critical pivot: **services before products**.

Products take 3-6+ months to monetize. Services pay within weeks.

**4 weeks to prove viability or pivot to employment.**

The clock is ticking. Let's execute.

**Current Week**: Week 1 of 4
**Next Milestone**: arcforge.au website live + 10 Upwork bids
